# Unimelb-Timetable-to-iCalendar-file

Converts your University of Melbourne timetable to an iCalendar file that can be imported into most calendar applications.

To use it, go to the timetable page on the student portal, press the expand all button and copy and paste the page into a file. (by copy and paste I mean use ctrl+a on the rendered page, not save the source). Then tell the program the location of that file and an output file name and it will make an iCal file in the same directory as the program. Very simple program and should work for 2015 S2 by default. For other semesters, the semester start and end dates will need to be changed. These are hard coded in.
